Drive away, 
As in lonesome sound, 
Like a real straight shooter, 
Three lanes full, 

Drive away, 
As in lonesome sound, 
Like a real straight shooter, 
Three lanes full, 

Gotta ride in my heart, 
Get 'em goin' down, 
You don't have to be a star, 
To, to get them goin' 'round 

Even if you try to move, 
Wheel it to your right, 
So get on, on the driving wheel, 
Save it for a round, 

Helpin' me, helpin' me, helpin' me 'round now
Helpin' me, helpin' me, helpin' me 'round now
